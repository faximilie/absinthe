# Absinthe

Aniseed never tasted so good 🧚🏼‍♂️

This is my Aniseed/Fennel configuration for Neovim, with almost everything possible done in fennel.

## Requirements

- git (for installing the project, and it's dependencies)
- Neovim (v0.8.3 is what works for me)

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:faximilie/absinthe.git ~/.config/nvim
```
